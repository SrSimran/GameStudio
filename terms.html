                While using Crickovers, the following points outline the limitations placed on users - </br>

                Crickovers should not be used in any way that violates applicable laws, infringes upon the rights of
                others, or interferes with the proper functioning of Crickovers. It includes, but is not limited to,
                hacking, tampering with the platform, and attempting to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. It is
